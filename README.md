What are AI Agents?
AI agents are based on an LLM. With Phidata you can work with almost any Large Language Model, such as OpenAI, Anthropic, but also local models with Ollama (such as LLama3.3 for example).

Ok, so how are they different from models such as ChatGPT? AI agents are build for a specific purpose, such as researching stock prices or handling customer service. And they can use resources designed for this purpose.

AI Agents can use the following:

Memory: to keep track of conversations and tasks they’re working on they can use short-term and long-term memory (just like yourself).
Knowledge: knowledge is different than memory. Knowledge can be research papers, recipes, manuals, etc.
Tools: AI agents can also execute tasks by using tools. They can add meetings to your calendar, use search engines, scrape data from websites etc. And they can combine these tools in a clever way to perform a task.
